# vimochana

absolutely ( and i mean that in the most absolute sense ) barebones static site generator. i'm doing this - and notice the lowercase "i", i am that unserious about this - to just get a blog up and running for the code stuff i do.

this readme is not for the world. it's for myself.

## to run:

- yarn build

## workflow:

- write some shit in markdown somewhere in your local machine
- add that to d.yaml file with title and date and path
- run `yarn build`

that's it.

## roadmap:

- override default template
- enable caching so builds are faster
